# Diff support in Atom

Adds syntax support for diffs. Originally
[converted](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-converting-from-textmate)
from the [Diff TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/diff.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
